// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

a/2 = C  
num /2 = C

If C = INT, then echo Even
If C != INT, then echo Odd


// Exercise 3: Calculate the Average of Five Numbers
	
a+b+c+d+e=X

X/5=Average
print average

ask for 5 numbers
add the 5 numbers together for sum
divide sum by 5
print on the screen the average of the 5 numbers

If a> b&&c&&d&&e
